**Nerien's Ovale Scripts** installs a new set of default class scripts for users of [Ovale Spell Priority](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/ovale).  These scripts are based on [SimulationCraft](http://code.google.com/p/simulationcraft/) and are meant to be used in live raiding scenarios where the player must make the important choices in the rotation.  Each script creates at least two primary icons:

* **Main Rotation Icon**: shows how to maximize DPS without the use of any cooldown abilities
* **Cooldown Icon**: suggests cooldowns or other situational abilities that can be applied at the current time

Each class script may also have additional icons for other class-specific information, e.g., to suggest dumping rage using [Heroic Strike](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=78) as a warrior or [Maul](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=6807) as a bear druid.

This addon also adds a slash-command **/ovale-restore** which can be used to remove a previously-saved custom script from the current Ovale profile and fallback to using the default script instead.  In this case, the fallback would be to the default class script installed by this addon.
